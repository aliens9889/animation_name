# Animation Name

This project is a mixed of elements. The name or phrase you want to use for this there is two ways to create it, one could be with **Adobe Illustrator** and the other one is with [Figma](www.figma.com). With both cases you can generate the **SVG** (code,tags,format) that will be use on the html file.

The others elements for this project will be HTML/CSS. HTML will be use to paste the SVG code and CSS will be used to create the animation.

The original tutorial is teached by Dev Ed you can check his Youtube Channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q/videos) if you're interesting in the Frontend Development, in this channel there are subjects that could be good for you.
